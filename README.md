# Future Primitive
## My personal blog on [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

## Deploy
```
bash deploy.sh
```

the randered page files is in another repo [Bittree.github.io](https://github.com/Bittree/Bittree.github.io), which is the different remote origin of dir 'public'. So that deploy.sh can 'hugo' once and push once to update modifications in source code of this repo and rendered page in Bittree.github.io repo. For more infomation see [Hugo`s Host on GitHub page](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
